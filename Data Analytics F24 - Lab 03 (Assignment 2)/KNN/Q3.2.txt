I had 2 models, both with features 'EPI', 'ECO', 'BDH', 'TBN', 'TKP'

One model had the regions: 'Eastern Europe', 'Greater Middle East', 'Asia-Pacific'
and the other had the regions: 'Global West', 'Former Soviet States', 'Latin America & Caribbean'


The second model ended up being better as it had a better overall accuracy, the first accuracy was 67%,
while my second model had an accuracy of 80%. It is important to note that my second model had slightly
more data points than the first.
