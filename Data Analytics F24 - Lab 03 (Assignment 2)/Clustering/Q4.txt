4.1.1)
The first model has a larger sum of squares within the clusters, making it a worser clustering
compared to the second model.

4.1.2)
Both plots show the within cluster sum of squares decreasing as k increases. This is expected, however the second model decreases to a lower sum of squares, making it still seem to be the better model.
