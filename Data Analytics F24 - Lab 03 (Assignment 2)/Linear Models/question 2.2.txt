2.2)

The model with all of the data used for training the model is certainly better.
The p-value for all of the variables with significant coefficients is much lower, 
giving us much more confidence that the null hypothesis of no association between
each individual variable and EPI is not true. 

ECO p-value for all data:              >2e-16
ECO p-value for eastern_europe subset: 0.273 (typically must be at most 0.05 to reject null hypothesis).
